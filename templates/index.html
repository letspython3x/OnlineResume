            <h1>Resume Submission Exercise</h1>
            <p>
                Generally, firms get a lot of spam-bot generated emails and unqualified resumes.
                So, In order to help pre-qualify job candidates firms can use the following programming exercise as a
                part of the resume submission process.
                In this exercise, the job applicant will create a simple web service that responds to requests
                from our client application. The client will ask applicant's service one question at a time,
                in no particular order, to which applicant's server should respond with an appropriate answer in plain
                text (not HTML).
